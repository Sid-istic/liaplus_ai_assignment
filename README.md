## 🧠 Overview

This submission showcases a conversational design for a chatbot assistant that guides prospective nursing students through the admission process. It covers multiple user intents, adapts to both positive and negative responses, and maintains a polite, helpful tone throughout.  
The conversation flow was written with empathy and clarity in mind, reflecting how real users naturally communicate in Hindi-English.
